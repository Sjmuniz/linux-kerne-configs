THis are very trimmed config files for the Dell D630.
The idea is leave behind a ton of code that either I do not use or is not needed for this particular hardware.
Of course YMMV, and this will most likely fail in your hardware :) Or not.
The benefits are hard to measure, if measurable at all.
Notice: Do not try to build you own kernel unless you either:
- Have a real issue, that you have learned can be fixed with a particular build.
- You have TONs of time, no boy/girl friend and you are willing to pull your hair for weeks before getting to a good result.
- You are curious to the point of willing to crash your machine, loose your data, and still comply with the above.
